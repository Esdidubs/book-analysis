# Book Analysis

[Live Page](https://esdidubs.github.io/book-analysis/)

I created this after having a lot of issues and errors with the Goodreads website. I needed an accurate tracking
of my reading, so I put together this website to track my books. At the same time as I was putting together this
site, I was learning about D3, which is what led to me adding graphs to the site to visualize my reading in various ways.

## Features
- Visual graphing of data using D3
- A list of all the books read along with number of total pages
- A sorting of the books by rank
- Individual year history
