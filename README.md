# Book Analysis

[Live Page](https://esdidubs.github.io/book-analysis/)

I created this after having a lot of issues and errors with the Goodreads website. I needed an accurate tracking
of my reading, so I put together this website to track my books.

## Features
- A list of all the books read along with number of total pages
- A sorting of the books by rank
- Individual year history
